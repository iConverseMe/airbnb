This is a programming problem that requires both thoughtful design and rapid coding.  It involves data searching, sorting, and optimization.  You will be provided with sample input files (four in total) and your program will need to generate the correct output.  Your final solution must be submitted and run against the test cases on InterviewStreet.  You can use any language you'd like (InterviewStreet supports about a dozen) and you will have 3 hours.  Any code that you re-use from elsewhere should be clearly identified as such. We ask that you write up a thoughtful analysis of the problem, including how your solution could be improved, and how the solution might vary depending on the distribution of the input data.  The best approach is to create a simple working solution to the problem, and combine that with a thoughtful writeup.
